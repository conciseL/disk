# disk
This is a program to detect U disk written in Java language. The interface is built using swing, which can dynamically display the obtained U disk information. Of course, the key is to correspond the obtained U disk SN number with the drive letter. However, the program can only support increased drive letters, that is, the inserted U disk can only be increased, and cannot be unplugged. Because the list is not updated during the plug-in process, the data will be incorrect. The program initializes the length of size to 7. This length can be modified by itself to support more.
